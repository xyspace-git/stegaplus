# StegaPlus

## Introduction
StegaPlus is a command-line tool that allows users to embed and extract data from images using steganography. It also provides features for downloading images, encrypting embedded data, and converting files to different formats (Base64, Hex).

## Planned Features (Yet to Add)
- Embed data into an image
- Extract data from an image
- Convert files to Base64 or Hex
- Download images from the internet
- Encrypt and decrypt data with a key
- GUI-based interaction (basic text-based)

## Installation
Run this to start working!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyspace-git/stegaplus.git &&
chmod +x stegaplus &&
cd stegaplus &&
./setup.sh 
```

## Notes
- The tool relies on external steganography software (`stegosuite`), so ensure it's installed.
